# Project Overview
This project is about to track the worldwide new cases, new recovered, new deaths as well as the total cases, recovered and deaths of COVID-19. We can also see the COVID-19 cases, recovered and deaths of each country as well as in a map and also can see the cases, recovered, deaths of the last 4 months of each country in a graph. I have used ReactJS, Material-UI and API to make this project.
